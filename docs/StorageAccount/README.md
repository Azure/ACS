# Azure Container Service - Storage Account

I don't know how to document this because I'm not familiar with what this actually is!

What I can infer is that this template suggests a Kubernetes cluster whose storage resources will all be constrained within a single `StorageAccount` resource type. Does it further suggest concrete features that will be included in the resultant Kubernetes cluster? Also, is this a Kubernetes-only feature of `2017-07-01`?
